    <h1>All About Milwaukee:</h1>
    <h2>Revisiting My Hometown</h2>
    
    <p>
        I was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, but have not been back to visit in about twenty years.
        I figure it is about time that I revisit the sights and places I remember, and maybe discover new ones along the way.

    <h2>Leon's Frozen Custard</h2>

      <p>I regularly visited Leon's as a child, and remember enjoying quite a 
          few Tin Roof Sundaes over the years. Leon's was also used to represent the
          exterior of Mel's Diner on Happy Days, which was set in Milwaukee.</p>

        <h3>Why is frozen custard so popular in Milwaukee?</h3>
        <p>I remember reading that frozen custard was invented in Coney Island in Brooklyn, NY, 
        but I can't remember seeing any frozen custard stands when I lived there (this is where my husband is from). I do remember
        visiting a variety of frozen custard spots in Milwaukee, however - from Kopp's to Oscar's to Leon's - and many more I can't remember.
        In fact, like a typical Milwaukeean, I never went to the usual Dairy Queen or soft serve place - it was always frozen custard.
        I think it was made popular when it was served at the Chicago World's Fair. I believe from there, it started to catch on in the midwest.</p>

    <h2>Milwaukee County Zoo</h2>

    <p>The Milwaukee County Zoo is a place I remember fondly. 
       My family was often there for family picnics and events and I continued to visit it as a teenager.
       The primate house was my favorite place in the zoo, which played a small part in my decision to study anthropology in college (the first time I went).</p>
    <h2>Summerfest</h2>

        <p>Summerfest is billed as the world's largest music festival, and it sure felt like that
        when I visited each summer as a teenager. The fun, festival atmosphere, plus the fact
        that most of the concerts were free kept many Milwaukeeans looking forward
        to this event every year. Many different ethnic festivals were also held on the fairgrounds, including Festa Italiana, GermanFest, etc.</p>
